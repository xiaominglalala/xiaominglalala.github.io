Recently, I finished a course on Coursera: [Python Project for AI & Application Development](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-project-for-ai-application-development)

**Update**: Also Fine Tune BERT for text Classification

This is the first time for me to get a certification!ðŸ˜ƒ I'm super excited ! I love this feeling! I'll take more courses and get more certifications!

I am now writing notes to **<u>summarize this project</u>**ðŸ˜Ž, and I believe it'll be posted to this website **<u>within 2 days</u>**.

But after receiving the certification, I met a question. I'll probably get a lot of advanced certifications and maybe some junior ones. I want people who visit my LinkedIn page to see those high-level credentials first, rather than looking for valuable credentials in a pile of credentials. But the problem is that **<u>LinkedIn does not support self-sorting of certificates</u>**. It sorts according to the certificate's issue date and expiration date!

After careful searching, I find a good solution: "For some certificates, that I want to place at the top of the list I use "**unprintable blank characters**" and don't set exp. date "(from comments of this [blog](https://www.clarkogier.com/blog/linkedin-hack))

So what is"**unprintable blank characters**"? People commonly call it an **empty character or blank space and hidden text**, etc. It is usually a blank Unicode character or text type such as U+0020, U+00A0, U+FEFF, etc. Unicode stands for the universal coded character set.

Wow, sounds great! I tried this method, and it worked! Here is a [website](https://www.editpad.org/tool/invisible-character) which provides **unprintable blank characters**.

By the way, I learned another trick when configuring the image path: **../** can help me find the last directory!
