## Binary Tree Exercise 3

#### [426. 将二叉搜索树转化为排序的双向链表](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/convert-binary-search-tree-to-sorted-doubly-linked-list/)

难度中等165

将一个 **二叉搜索树** 就地转化为一个 **已排序的双向循环链表** 。

对于双向循环列表，你可以将左右孩子指针作为双向循环链表的前驱和后继指针，第一个节点的前驱是最后一个节点，最后一个节点的后继是第一个节点。

特别地，我们希望可以 **就地** 完成转换操作。当转化完成以后，树中节点的左指针需要指向前驱，树中节点的右指针需要指向后继。还需要返回链表中最小元素的指针。

 

**示例 1：**

```
输入：root = [4,2,5,1,3] 


输出：[1,2,3,4,5]

解释：下图显示了转化后的二叉搜索树，实线表示后继关系，虚线表示前驱关系。
```

**示例 2：**

```
输入：root = [2,1,3]
输出：[1,2,3]
```

**示例 3：**

```
输入：root = []
输出：[]
解释：输入是空树，所以输出也是空链表。
```

**示例 4：**

```
输入：root = [1]
输出：[1]
```

 

**提示：**

- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
- `Node.left.val < Node.val < Node.right.val`
- `Node.val` 的所有值都是独一无二的
- `0 <= Number of Nodes <= 2000`

#### [543. Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)

难度简单1019

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the length of the **diameter** of the tree*.

The **diameter** of a binary tree is the **length** of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the `root`.

The **length** of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiaominglalala/pic/main/img/diamtree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

#### [173. Binary Search Tree Iterator](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/binary-search-tree-iterator/)

难度中等591

Implement the `BSTIterator` class that represents an iterator over the **[in-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#In-order_(LNR))** of a binary search tree (BST):

- `BSTIterator(TreeNode root)` Initializes an object of the `BSTIterator` class. The `root` of the BST is given as part of the constructor. The pointer should be initialized to a non-existent number smaller than any element in the BST.
- `boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if there exists a number in the traversal to the right of the pointer, otherwise returns `false`.
- `int next()` Moves the pointer to the right, then returns the number at the pointer.

Notice that by initializing the pointer to a non-existent smallest number, the first call to `next()` will return the smallest element in the BST.

You may assume that `next()` calls will always be valid. That is, there will be at least a next number in the in-order traversal when `next()` is called.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiaominglalala/pic/main/img/bst-tree.png)

```
Input
["BSTIterator", "next", "next", "hasNext", "next", "hasNext", "next", "hasNext", "next", "hasNext"]
[[[7, 3, 15, null, null, 9, 20]], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]
Output
[null, 3, 7, true, 9, true, 15, true, 20, false]

Explanation
BSTIterator bSTIterator = new BSTIterator([7, 3, 15, null, null, 9, 20]);
bSTIterator.next();    // return 3
bSTIterator.next();    // return 7
bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True
bSTIterator.next();    // return 9
bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True
bSTIterator.next();    // return 15
bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True
bSTIterator.next();    // return 20
bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return False
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 105]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 106`
- At most `105` calls will be made to `hasNext`, and `next`.

 

**Follow up:**

- Could you implement `next()` and `hasNext()` to run in average `O(1)` time and use `O(h)` memory, where `h` is the height of the tree?

#### [129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/)

难度中等522

You are given the `root` of a binary tree containing digits from `0` to `9` only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

- For example, the root-to-leaf path `1 -> 2 -> 3` represents the number `123`.

Return *the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers*. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.

A **leaf** node is a node with no children.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/num1tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiaominglalala/pic/main/img/num2tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [4,9,0,5,1]
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- The depth of the tree will not exceed `10`.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "-4(2(3)(1))(6(5)(7))"
Output: [-4,2,6,3,1,5,7]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 3 * 104`
- `s` consists of digits, `'('`, `')'`, and `'-'` only.

#### [124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/)

难度困难1566

A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once**. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The **path sum** of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the maximum **path sum** of any **non-empty** path*.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiaominglalala/pic/main/img/exx1.jpg)

#### [428. Serialize and Deserialize N-ary Tree](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-n-ary-tree/)

难度困难88

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize an N-ary tree. An N-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than N children. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that an N-ary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

For example, you may serialize the following `3-ary` tree

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiaominglalala/pic/main/img/narytreeexample.png)

 

as `[1 [3[5 6] 2 4]]`. Note that this is just an example, you do not necessarily need to follow this format.

Or you can follow LeetCode's level order traversal serialization format, where each group of children is separated by the null value.

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiaominglalala/pic/main/img/sample_4_964.png)

 

For example, the above tree may be serialized as `[1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]`.

You do not necessarily need to follow the above-suggested formats, there are many more different formats that work so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 104`
- The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to `1000`
- Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your encode and decode algorithms should be stateless.

#### [297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/)

难度困难855

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Clarification:** The input/output format is the same as [how LeetCode serializes a binary tree](https://leetcode-cn.com/faq/#binary-tree). You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/15/serdeser.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

#### [366. Find Leaves of Binary Tree](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/find-leaves-of-binary-tree/)

难度中等172

Given the `root` of a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this:

- Collect all the leaf nodes.
- Remove all the leaf nodes.
- Repeat until the tree is empty.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiaominglalala/pic/main/img/remleaves-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [[4,5,3],[2],[1]]
Explanation:
[[3,5,4],[2],[1]] and [[3,4,5],[2],[1]] are also considered correct answers since per each level it does not matter the order on which elements are returned.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`



#### [103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/)

难度中等633

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values*. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/tree1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

#### [427. Construct Quad Tree](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/construct-quad-tree/)

难度中等156

Given a `n * n` matrix `grid` of `0's` and `1's` only. We want to represent the `grid` with a Quad-Tree.

Return *the root of the Quad-Tree* representing the `grid`.

Notice that you can assign the value of a node to **True** or **False** when `isLeaf` is **False**, and both are **accepted** in the answer.

A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:

- `val`: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.
- `isLeaf`: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.

```
class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}
```

We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:

1. If the current grid has the same value (i.e all `1's` or all `0's`) set `isLeaf` True and set `val` to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.
2. If the current grid has different values, set `isLeaf` to False and set `val` to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.
3. Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiaominglalala/pic/main/img/new_top.png)

If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree).

**Quad-Tree format:**

The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where `null` signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list `[isLeaf, val]`.

If the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is True we represent it as **1** in the list `[isLeaf, val]` and if the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is False we represent it as **0**.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/11/grid1.png)

```
Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: The explanation of this example is shown below:
Notice that 0 represnts False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/12/e2mat.png)

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]
Explanation: All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.
The topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value.
The topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.
Explanation is shown in the photo below:
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == grid.length == grid[i].length`
- `n == 2x` where `0 <= x <= 6`
