## Some advice received from Prof. Sherr

I have great respect for [Prof. Sherr](https://seclab.cs.georgetown.edu/msherr/), he is intelligent, patient, responsible, and knowledgeable. 

Honestly, I think he's the best professor I've ever seen at Georgetown.

Here are some advice from him:

> 1. Don’t chase money
>    –If you do CS, you’ll (eventually) have enough money
>    –Mansions, fancy cars, and really big TVs don’t really matter

To be honest, the main reason why I choose CS is because of the salary. Of course, there are many opportunities for our creativity in this industry, but obviously, that's not my top priority.

Maybe when I'm out of material pursuits, which means I can afford to buy most of the things I like at any time with my own income, I'll try to create something meaningful as my priority.

> 2. Don’t make your job the thing you put all of your eggs into
>    –You can love your job, but don’t make it your sole criteria for life success

> 3. Having a fulfilling job is wicked important
>    –Do something that lets you **exercise your creativity**
>    –Good news: most CS jobs fall into this category

"Exercise your creativity" is the crucial point. 

I love to create, and in the past, I've loved designing game characters, skills, and backstories. Of course, it would make me happy. However, it would be great if I could create something that would make everyone happy and generate income for me!

> 4. Learn to deal with difficult people
>    –And learn how to avoid them

Most of them are stupid and greedy...😅

The way to avoid ruining your mood is to avoid them.

> 5. Resiliency is hard, but it’s super important
>    –Learn how to find your own “reset” button
>    –And learn to laugh at yourself

> 6. You can be competitive – there’s nothing wrong with that.
>    But don’t be myopic. Don’t strive for something at the expense of other things that matter more

> 7. Remember that you are young, and have plenty of time to make many, many, many stupid mistakes. Go make stupid mistakes. It’s how you learn.

This is the sentence that moved me the most. 

I have always been am a boy who afraid of making mistakes, afraid of being considered stupid, and so afraid of trying. 

Now, I should cherish the years when I can make mistakes. 

I should keep trying, not be afraid to do stupid things, not be afraid to make mistakes and keep learning. 

Make mistakes - Learn - Grow!

> 8. Computer science isn’t about a tool or particular technology. It’s the science of computing. That’s much more valuable.
>
> 9. There are SO many opportunities to use computer science for good.
>    • These jobs can be super rewarding.
>
> 10. It’s not your responsibility to save the world.
>     • It is your responsibility to improve it a wee bit. At the very least, please don’t make it worse.
>     • But if you want to save the world, that’s cool too.
>
> 11. There will always be someone {smarter, faster, more knowledgeable, etc.} than you.
>     • In fact, try to find a job where you’ll be surrounded by smart, talented folks\
> 12. At the same time, imposter syndrome is super real
>     •Give yourself credit where credit is due. You deserve your accolades.
